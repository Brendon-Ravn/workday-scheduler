# Workday Scheduler
This was a homework assignment to create a planner or scheduler for your workday.<br />I had a lot of fun with this one. There were a few places I had to ask for <br />
outside help but I eventually got it figured out.

## Usage
When you open the scheduler it will have hour blocks for your work day.<br />
Each block will be a different color depending on if it is the current hour <br />
(red), a future hour(green), or the hour has passed(gray). It will save your <br /> inputs to local storage so you can go back to the page and change, erase, or<br />
add new appointments.
